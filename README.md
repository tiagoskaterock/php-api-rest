# Study Project: APIs in PHP - From Basic to Advanced

This is a project developed as part of the "APIs in PHP: From Basic to Advanced" course on Udemy. In this course, I learned how to create a RESTful API using PHP, covering basic concepts to advanced techniques.

## Project Description

The project consists of creating a REST API in PHP, using the principles and best practices taught in the course. The API is capable of handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on specific resources, using appropriate HTTP methods.

## Key Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Implementation of basic operations to create, read, update, and delete resources through the API.
<!--- -->
<!--- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implementation of an authentication and authorization system to protect certain endpoints of the API.-->
